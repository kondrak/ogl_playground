# OpenGL playground
My personal SDL2 and Glew based stub project with 6DOF WASD camera for OpenGL experiments. Targetted at VS2015 development. Basic math functionality and simple debug overlay (FPS counter) included.
This is a download-and-get-running-asap type of a project for your quick development pleasure. All binaries and .dll (64 bit) files included to avoid unnecessary hassle.
